  <h2>What Is Game Theory?</h2>
  <p>
    Game theory is a field in mathematics that deals with problems in which multiple actors, called players, take a
    decision. The name suggests that it has to do with board games, or computer games. Originally game theory was
    used to analyse board game strategies; however, nowadays it is used for a lot of real-world problems.
  </p>
  <p>
    In a mathematical game, the payoff of a player is not only determined by his own choice of strategy, but also by
    the strategies chosen by the other players. Therefore it is important to anticipate the other players' actions.
    Game theory tries to analyse the optimal strategy for multiple types of games.
  </p>
  <h2>Non-Cooperative Game Theory</h2>
  <p>
    A subfield of game theory is the non-cooperative game theory. This field deals with problems where the players
    cannot cooperate and have to decide on their strategy without being able to discuss with the other players.
