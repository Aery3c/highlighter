      In this game, both (Top,Left) and (Bottom,Right) are Nash equilibria. If A and B choose (Top,Left) then A can
      switch to Bottom, but this would reduce his payoff from 5 to 1. Player B can switch from left to right, but this
      would reduce his payoff from 4 to 3.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the players are in (Bottom,Right) player A can switch, but then he reduces his payoff from 4 to 2 and player
      B can only reduce his payoff from 9 to 7.
    </p>
    <h2>Games Without a Nash Equilibrium</h2>
    <p>
      Besides having one or multiple Nash equilibria, it is also possible for a game to have no Nash equilibrium. An
      example of a game that has no Nash equilibrium is shown in the table below.
